**Note:** Column names (e.g., `Salary Paid` vs. `Salary`) and data formats (e.g., salaries as currency strings `"$123,456.78"` vs. numeric `123456.78`) may vary between different years' files, requiring appropriate parsing.

See the [assignment ideas file](assignment-ideas.md) for some programming tasks that can be performed with this data (originally suggested by Google Gemini).

**Usage Tip:** If consuming these files directly from an online repository (like GitHub), ensure you use the 'Raw' file link to fetch the plain text CSV data, rather than an HTML view of the file.
